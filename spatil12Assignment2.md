Website for Symptom Tracking and Abnormality Detection

Brief Summary of the Project Idea:
We propose a website for predictive healthcare that would allow users to monitor both their symptoms and health information on a single platform. Machine learning algorithms will be used by the website to analyze user data and spot any strange trends or symptoms that might call for medical treatment.  

Problem Being Solved:
People frequently fail to successfully manage their health data in today's fast-paced world, which results in lost possibilities for early identification and prevention of health disorders. By providing a digital platform that enables users to enter and monitor their symptoms over time, our initiative seeks to solve this issue. Additionally, the platform will be able to recognize potential warning signs and advise users to seek medical care right away with machine learning.

Major Features:
User Profiles and Data Input: Users will create accounts and input their basic health information. They can track vital signs, log their symptoms and allergies, record medications, and blood reports, and document their medical history conveniently in one place.

The system will analyze this data to identify trends and correlations that might go unnoticed by the user.

Machine Learning-Based Abnormality Detection: Using machine learning algorithms, the platform will develop personalized baselines for health measurements by learning from user data. The system will then look for departures from these norms and notify users of any odd behaviour that might call for medical treatment.

Notification system: Based on the data analysis, the website will have a notification system that alerts users to potential health issues. When major deviations or frightening symptoms are found, users will receive alerts urging them to speak with a healthcare expert.


Languages, Tool Sets, Third-Party Code, etc.:

Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to create the website's user interface.

Python will be used to build the backend, which will provide a strong framework for user authentication, data administration, and communication with the machine learning model.

Database: MySQL will be used to store user profiles, health data, and symptom history securely.

Machine Learning: Python libraries like TensorFlow will be utilized to develop the machine learning model for abnormality detection based on user data.


Target Market: People who are interested in taking a proactive approach to maintaining their health are part of the target market for this service. The platform for predictive healthcare is especially helpful for those with hectic schedules who might skip their annual physicals. It is also useful for those who encounter chronic diseases and need to monitor their symptoms consistently.
